# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
o	The purpose of this analysis is to help Danaâ€™s to show the data regarding UFOs in a HTML page and allow user to do research by filtering by multiple criteria at the same time as the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
* The research can now be done with different filter as shown in the bellow image this will help the user to use the data efficiently instead of having the search in the huge amount of data.

## Summary:
* Drawback:
The main drawback of this webpage is that the user needs to input the right data in order to filter. This mean that the user must know what to search before inputting the data to filter.

* Recommendations for further development 
We recommend adding a scrolling menu for city, state, country, and shape so that even if the user do not have any knowledge of the data present, we will suggest the research to perform based on the available data present.
Also, instead of having one date to filter we could input a filter based on a range of date e.g. from: 1/1/2010 to 01/01/2021. This will be easier for a user then to enter a specific date.
